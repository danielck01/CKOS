# Runtime Backend Roadmap

## Purpose

This folder is an auxiliary governed roadmap for runtime backend. It supports planning, study, sequencing, risk analysis and future approval gates. It does not create canonical authority and does not authorize implementation.

## Scope

- event bus
- policy engine
- model router
- context pack builder
- approval gate
- cost guard
- audit logs
- projection engine

## Out of Scope

- backend implementation
- API implementation
- database schema or migration
- runtime agent execution
- production deployment

## Minimum Read Order

1. `000_ROADMAPS/README.md`
2. `000_ROADMAPS/ck_memory.md`
3. This README.md
4. This ck_memory.md
5. This ck_tasks.md
6. This ck_risks.md
7. This ck_roi.md
8. This ck_agent_handoffs.md

## Operating Rule

Use the Intent -> Question -> Plan -> Execution pattern. No question should appear without at least one explicit ROI, risk, cost or consequence. One agent may write a proposed artifact; another agent or PMO role must audit before the result is treated as accepted.

## Security / Governance / Cost / Approval Impact

Runtime planning must answer approval, audit, tenant isolation, cost guard and rollback impact before any implementation gate.

Every relevant task must answer:

- Does this touch sensitive data?
- Does this require Founder approval?
- Does this create cost or credits impact?
- Does this create cross-tenant, secret, public-output or external-tool risk?
- Can it be reverted?
- What evidence or audit log should exist?

## Acceptance Criteria

- The seven control files exist in this folder.
- YAML follows CKOS auxiliary pattern.
- No canonical docs are changed.
- No implementation is started.
- Risks, ROI and handoff rules are visible before P2 planning.
