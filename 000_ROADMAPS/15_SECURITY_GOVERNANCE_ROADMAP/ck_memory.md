# Security Governance Roadmap - Memory

## Current State

This roadmap was created during P1 Missing Roadmaps Completion as a draft auxiliary planning lane. It is ready for PMO review and later Founder-approved expansion.

## Approved Decisions

- Keep this roadmap auxiliary, not canonical.
- Keep implementation blocked until a future explicit gate.
- Use minimum context before asking agents to act.
- Require checkout lock before any write operation.

## Files Created

- README.md
- ck_memory.md
- ck_tasks.md
- ck_risks.md
- ck_roi.md
- ck_feedback.md
- ck_agent_handoffs.md

## Dependencies

- approval policy
- data sensitivity
- cross-tenant risk
- secret handling
- audit logs
- cost guard
- policy checks
- security acceptance criteria

## Do Not Do

- canonical governance edits
- security implementation
- secret creation
- tenant policy changes
- runtime enforcement code

## Risks Remaining

- Duplicate scope may exist with earlier roadmap folders.
- Future sessions may over-read context instead of using targeted packs.
- Study language may be mistaken for implementation approval.

## Next Recommended Action

PMO review should reconcile this roadmap with existing 00-13 roadmap folders, then propose P2 expansion only where useful.
