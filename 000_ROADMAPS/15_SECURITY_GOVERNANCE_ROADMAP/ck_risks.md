framework:
  - "Intent -> Question -> Plan -> Execution"
  - "SPCCAE"
  - "one agent writes and another audits"
  - "Security / Governance / Cost / Approval Impact"
edge_cases:
  - "roadmap treated as canonical authority"
  - "agent starts implementation from study material"
  - "duplicate scope with earlier roadmap folders"
  - "context pack grows beyond task need"
  - "approval bypass"
integrations:
  - "approval policy (planning only)"
  - "data sensitivity (planning only)"
  - "cross-tenant risk (planning only)"
  - "secret handling (planning only)"
  - "audit logs (planning only)"
  - "cost guard (planning only)"
  - "policy checks (planning only)"
  - "security acceptance criteria (planning only)"
prompts:
  - "Read README.md and ck_memory.md before action."
  - "Ask Founder approval before any patch outside this folder."
  - "Show ROI, risk, cost and consequence for every major question."
metrics:
  - "all seven root controls exist"
  - "0 canonical docs changed"
  - "0 implementation files changed"
  - "YAML valid"
  - "handoff rules visible"

# Security Governance Roadmap - Risks

| risk_id | risk_type | severity | probability | impact | trigger | mitigation | owner | status |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15_security_governance_risk_001 | documental | medium | medium | duplicated or stale roadmap guidance | earlier roadmap folder already covers part of this scope | reconcile before P2 expansion | pmo_ckos | open |
| 15_security_governance_risk_002 | governanca | high | low | auxiliary roadmap mistaken for canonical rule | agent cites this folder as final authority | keep canonical references explicit and require Founder approval | pmo_ckos | open |
| 15_security_governance_risk_003 | custo_contexto | medium | medium | agents read too much and burn context | broad research request without task pack | use minimum read order and context pack | ceo_agent_ckos | open |
| 15_security_governance_risk_004 | agente | high | medium | parallel sessions overwrite or contradict each other | no checkout lock or missing handoff | one agent writes, another audits, handoff required | pmo_ckos | open |
| 15_security_governance_risk_005 | implementacao_prematura | high | medium | planning turns into code, API, UI or connector work | executor receives visual or technical reference as build instruction | block implementation until explicit future gate | founder | open |

## Mitigation Owner Rule

PMO_CKOS owns documentary and governance mitigation. CEO_AGENT_CKOS owns planning and handoff clarity. Founder owns exceptions, blockers and future implementation authorization.
